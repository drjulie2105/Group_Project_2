## Getting Started

We brainstormed

## Consolidating the Data

We collected the data and then manipulated and join the data sets together into one database using python in visual basic.

These are the steps we took as milestones to merge the data sets: importing files, reading files, merging tables, changing column names, removing some columns, and changing all column names to all lower case letters in order to smoothly connect with PostgreSQL.

## Importing Data 
* To PostgresSQL (pgAdmin) - we finally created a Database and Table within pgAdmin and inserted each column name and its datatype.
* Flask App

## Final Product
